# Karma Police

Karma Police is a Reddit client that allows users to browse posts from a selected subreddit and sort them based on the user's total karma score.

## Technologies Used

- Git version control: Version control system for tracking changes in source code during development.
- GitHub Pages: Static site hosting service for deploying and showcasing web applications.
- GitHub Actions: CI/CD platform for automating workflows and tasks in software development.
- Jest: JavaScript testing framework for writing and running tests.
- Enzyme: JavaScript testing utility for testing React components' output and behavior.

## Features

- Fetches and displays posts from a selected subreddit.
- Sorts posts based on the user's total karma score (ascending or descending).
- Allows users to "arrest" specific Reddit users, preventing their posts from being displayed.
- Provides a responsive and intuitive user interface for easy navigation and interaction.
- Supports dark and light themes for personalized user experience.
- Mobile view features a clean, compact menu system with animations.

## Future Work

I was keen to avoid scope creep, so kept this project within the brief outlined on Codecademy. However if I were to develop this app further, I'd like to add the following features:

- Loading animations for cards and their components.
- Implement subreddit searches.
- Allow users to add their own Reddit account and fetch subreddits they are subscribed to.
- Switch to Reddit's official API.
- Add karma awarding (requires official Reddit API).
- Add poll voting & post commenting.
- Store app state in user's session storage.
- Ensure Reddit videos have sound (requires official Reddit API).
